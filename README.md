# Listy App
This app is a rudimentary version of craigslist that allows users to create accounts using different OAuth providers or by entering a username, email and password. Users who've created their own accounts have the ability to update their profile username, password, email and photo. Users can create listings which are displayed in order of their creation date on the homepage. Users can filter listings by categories.
